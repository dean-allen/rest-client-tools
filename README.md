Service Discovery - deprecated 
-----------------

The UriProvider described here is deprecated and will soon be replaced with SimpleUriProvider in conjunction with synapse-lite. 
This will make the client code a lot simpler and much less error prone in many cases. This will also take a bunch of load off our
zookeeper cluster.

The first step when building your client is to create a ServiceDiscovery instance. As of archmage 0.4.0, if the client of your service is itself another Archmage service, the Curator ServiceDiscovery instance will be available to you from the BasicService class:

    ServiceDiscovery serviceDiscovery = basicService.getServiceDiscovery(); // the curator service discovery instance will be available
                                                                            // to you from in BasicService class in archmage services

If the client of your service is NOT another Archmage service, you will need to build your own Curator ServiceDiscovery instance:

    String connectString = "dev-zookeeper-1001.va.opower.it,dev-zookeeper-1002.va.opower.it" // string of the format (IP:Port,IP:Port,IP:Port) used connect to our ZooKeeper servers.
    RetryPolicy retryPolicy = new RetryOneTime(1000) // See http://curator.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/curator/RetryPolicy.html
 
    CuratorFramework curatorFramework = CuratorFrameworkFactory.newClient(connectString, retryPolicy); // start by getting a CuratorFramework instance. 
    curatorFramework.start();
 
    ServiceDiscovery<Void> serviceDiscovery = ServiceDiscoveryBuilder.builder(Void.class)
                .client(checkNotNull(curatorFramework))
                .basePath(BASE_PATH + pathTier)             // This needs to be /services/[tier]
                .build();                                   // "[tier]" is one of the Strings in
                                                            // com.opower.archmage.Tier :
                                                            // {development, implementation, local, production, scale, stage}
    
Once you have a serviceDiscovery instance, you can build your very own OpowerClient.

    String serviceName = "example-v1"; // this String must match the string that the archmage service used to register itself in zookeeper.
                                       // In archmage you can obtain this by calling serviceName.getServiceName()
 
    String clientId = OAUTH_CLIENT_ID // if not using auth, make sure to specify a unique static clientID that you can look for in opentsdb to find
                                      // stats for your client. This should not be generated uniquely at runtime.
 
    OpowerClient.Builder<FrobResource> clientBuilder = new OpowerClient.Builder<>(FrobResource.class, serviceDiscovery, serviceName, OAUTH_CLIENT_ID)
                            .clientSecret(OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET); // by specifying the oauth2 client secret, 
                                                               // you enable the auth-service integration
    FrobResource client = clientBuilder.build();
 
    // now I can access the service with the client
    Frob f = client.findFrob("frobId);

Configuration Overview
======================

There are many different options for configuring your client instances. What follows is an overview of the various settings that are available to you. We have provided sensible defaults that should work in many cases. However you might have special settings needed for your particular client. Note that these builder methods should be invoked before calling build().

The client's authorization-service integration automatically refreshes tokens for you. This process will start before the token expires to provide a buffer against failed requests. This setting specifies the number of seconds prior to token expiration that the refresh process should start. The default value is 2 seconds. If you need to expand this buffer you can do so like this:

    clientBuilder.tokenTtlRefreshSeconds(5); // isn't that nice that the methods spells out the units?

Metrics collection and publishing to sensu are enabled by default. If for some strange reason you need to disable this (and it would indeed be strange) you can disable one or both. If you feel you need to disable this, please discuss your requirements with Core Platform.

    clientBuilder.disableMetrics(); // sad y u no like metrics?
    clientBuilder.disableSensuPublishing(); // also sad :(

You may need to alter the proxy's requests before they are sent. For instance, you may need to add a header or some other parameter to the request. (By default, your client adds a request_id parameter and an X-Service-Name header.) You use ClientRequestFilter to customize the requests:

    ClientRequestFilter filter = new ClientRequestFilter() {
            @Override
            public void filter(ClientRequest request) {
                // add a http header to the client requests
                request.header("header name", "header value");
            }
    };
 
    clientBuilder.addClientRequestFilter(filter); // filters are applied in the order they are added.
    
ClientErrorInterceptor defines the proxy's behavior in case of errors. By default, each OpowerClient uses the ExceptionMapperInterceptor which maps http status codes to nicely named exceptions. This should be sufficient for most cases. Check out the source code of ExceptionMapperInterceptor if you have more questions. Here is how you would specify your own list of custom ClientErrorInterceptors, which would replace the default ClientErrorInterceptor:

    List<ClientErrorInterceptor> interceptors = ImmutableList.<ClientErrorInterceptor>of(new ClientErrorInterceptor() {
            @Override
            public void handle(ClientResponse<?> response) throws RuntimeException {
                // handle the error response as you see fit
                throw new SpecialException(response.getResponseStatus());
            }
        });
 
    clientBuilder.clientErrorInterceptors(interceptors); // replaces the default list. The default is pretty good are you sure?

If you need to make changes to the Jackson layer â€“ e.g., enabling or disabling features based on the remote service's requirements -- you can use a ConfigurationCallback. The OpowerClient.Builder allows you to customize the internal JacksonJsonProvider / ObjectMapper instances via ConfigurationCallback instances. Think of it as a ruby block or a lambda when we finally get java 8.  Here is how you use ConfigurationCallback:

    clientBuilder.configureObjectMapper(new ConfigurationCallback<ObjectMapper>() {
                            @Override
                            public void configure(ObjectMapper objectMapper) {
                                // here you can configure the ObjectMapper as needed
                                objectMapper.enable(DeserializationFeature.READ_ENUMS_USING_TO_STRING);
                            }
                        })
      .configureJacksonJsonProvider(new ConfigurationCallback<JacksonJsonProvider>() {
                            @Override
                            public void configure(JacksonJsonProvider jacksonJsonProvider) {
                                // here you can configure the JacksonJsonProvider as needed
                                jacksonJsonProvider.configure(DeserializationFeature.WRAP_EXCEPTIONS, false);
                            }
                        });

Client proxy instances use Apache's httpclient to make requests. By default, requests that cause a 503 response will be retried once after one second. You can tweak the number of retries and starting interval for retries (the interval increases exponentially up to 10s). Also you can manipulate the HttpParams instance for the client using the ConfigurationCallback mechanism.

    clientBuilder.configureRetries(3, 3000) // the sleep interval is in milliseconds
        .httpClientParams(new ConfigurationCallback<HttpParams>() {
              @Override
              public void configure(HttpParams httpParams) {
              // http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.2.x/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/http/client/params/HttpClientParams.html
                  HttpClientParams.setRedirecting(httpParams, true);               
              }
        });
        
All method invocations on client proxies are wrapped with a HystrixCommand object. Each method on your resource interface will receive its own HystrixCommandKey. This key can be overridden but shouldn't need to be (we know; you're a snowflake). The HystrixCommandProperties and HystrixThreadPoolProperties can be configured for individual methods or for the whole resource. You can also specify a fallback if a command fails. Have a look:
 
    Method findFrob = FrobResource.class.getMethod("findFrob");
    clientBuilder.methodCommandKey(findFrob, HystrixCommandKey.Factory.asKey("BEAUTIFUL_SNOWFLAKE"));
 
    // this changes the command timeout for just the findFrob method with razor-like precision
    clientBuilder.methodProperties(findFrob, new ConfigurationCallback<HystrixCommandProperties.Setter>() {
                    @Override
                    public void configure(HystrixCommandProperties.Setter setter) {
                        setter.withExecutionIsolationThreadTimeoutInMilliseconds(5000);
                    }
    });
 
    // you don't have to do it for each method invidually though. 
    // Let's change the core pool size for all of the methods on the ResourceInterface
    clientBuilder.threadPoolProperties(new ConfigurationCallback<HystrixThreadPoolProperties.Setter>() {
                    @Override
                    public void configure(HystrixThreadPoolProperties.Setter setter) {
                        setter.withCoreSize(10);
                    }
     });
 
    // how about a fallback?
    clientBuilder.methodFallback(findFrob, new Callable<Object>() {
            @Override
            public Object call() throws Exception {
                Frob default = new Frob();
                default.setId("default");
                default.setName("Generic");
                return default;
            }
    });
